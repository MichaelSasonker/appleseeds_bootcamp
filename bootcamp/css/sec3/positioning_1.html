<!-- 
    Becuase we have here parent element we need to write inside it
    "position: relative" so the child element will move 
    relative to his parent. 
    An element with "position: absolute" is positioned relative to 
    the nearest positioned ancestor 
    (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed).
    However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned 
    ancestors, it uses the document body, 
    and moves along with page scrolling.
